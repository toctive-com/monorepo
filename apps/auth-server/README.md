This is the authentication server for the Toctive project. It is a simple Node.js application that uses the [jsonwebtoken](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken) authentication library to provide authentication for the Toctive web application.

## Requirements

- Node.js 12.16.1
- MongoDB 4.2.3
- Yarn 1.22.4

## Installation

- Clone the repository
- Install dependencies with `yarn install`
- Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

```bash
# MongoDB connection string
MONGODB_URL=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/toctive-auth

# Port to run the server on
PORT=3000

# JWT keys to generate tokens
ACCESS_TOKEN_PRIVATE_KEY="ACCESS"
REFRESH_TOKEN_PRIVATE_KEY="REFRESH"
```

> Note: you can rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and change the values.

- Run the server with `yarn nx run auth-server:serve`
- The server should now be running on `http://localhost:3000` or any other port you specified in the `.env` file.
- You can now use the API to register and login users

## Usage

To use the API, See the [Routes API documentation](./docs/routes.md).
